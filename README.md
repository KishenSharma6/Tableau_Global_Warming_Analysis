In the following repo, I will be conducting an analysis in Tableau that aims to answer the following
*	Visualize rain and temp w/ co2 emissions and maybe population growth from 
*	How have rates of population increased urbanization and impacted CO2 emissions
*	How have co2 emissions changed globally? Which countries are the largest contributors (normalized by population)? Have rain or temperature changes occurred in these countries?
